### 1. Addressing Modes in the TCP/IP Model (CO1)

The TCP/IP model utilizes a hierarchical addressing scheme, employing different types of addresses at various layers to facilitate communication between devices and processes across a network. These addressing modes ensure that data can be correctly delivered from a source application to a destination application, potentially traversing multiple networks and devices.

The primary addressing modes are:

1.  **Hardware/MAC Addressing (Data Link Layer - Layer 2)**
2.  **IP Addressing (Network Layer - Layer 3)**
3.  **Port Addressing (Transport Layer - Layer 4)**
4.  **Application Layer Addressing (Application Layer - Layer 5)**

Let's elaborate on each:

#### 1.1 Hardware/MAC Addressing (Layer 2)

*   **Purpose:** Identifies a specific network interface card (NIC) within a local area network (LAN) segment. It's used for physical, local delivery of frames.
*   **Format:** A 48-bit (6-byte) hexadecimal address, usually represented as six pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by hyphens or colons (e.g., `00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E`).
*   **Structure:** The first 24 bits (3 bytes) form the Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI), assigned by the IEEE to manufacturers. The remaining 24 bits are assigned by the manufacturer to uniquely identify each NIC.
*   **Uniqueness:** MAC addresses are designed to be globally unique, burned into the hardware.
*   **Communication Types:**
    *   **Unicast:** A frame is sent from one NIC to another specific NIC.
    *   **Broadcast:** A frame is sent to all devices on the local network segment (MAC address `FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF`).
    *   **Multicast:** A frame is sent to a specific group of devices on the local network (MAC addresses starting with `01-00-5E` for IPv4 or `33-33` for IPv6).
*   **Role:** Primarily used by switches to forward frames to the correct port within a LAN segment. Routers do not forward frames based on MAC addresses across different networks; they decapsulate the frame, make a routing decision based on the IP address, and then encapsulate the IP packet into a new frame with new source/destination MAC addresses for the next hop.

#### 1.2 IP Addressing (Layer 3)

*   **Purpose:** Identifies a unique host interface on a network and provides a logical address for end-to-end communication across interconnected networks (internetworks). IP addresses are hierarchical and routable.
*   **Types:**
    *   **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):**
        *   **Format:** A 32-bit numerical address, typically represented in dotted-decimal notation (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).
        *   **Structure:** Consists of a network portion (identifying the network) and a host portion (identifying the specific device on that network). Subnet masks are used to distinguish these parts.
        *   **Communication Types:**
            *   **Unicast:** One-to-one communication with a single destination host.
            *   **Broadcast:** One-to-all communication within a specific network segment (e.g., `192.168.1.255`). Routers typically do not forward broadcast traffic.
            *   **Multicast:** One-to-many communication with a group of hosts that have joined a specific multicast group (e.g., addresses in the `224.0.0.0/4` range).
    *   **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):**
        *   **Format:** A 128-bit hexadecimal address, typically represented in eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., `2001:0DB8:85A3:0000:0000:8A2E:0370:7334`).
        *   **Structure:** Also hierarchical, designed to overcome the address exhaustion of IPv4 and provide improved routing efficiency.
        *   **Communication Types:**
            *   **Unicast:** One-to-one communication.
            *   **Multicast:** One-to-many communication to a group of interfaces.
            *   **Anycast:** One-to-one-of-many communication, where a packet is delivered to the nearest host (in terms of routing distance) among a group of hosts sharing the same anycast address.
*   **Role:** Crucial for routing packets between different networks. Routers use IP addresses to determine the optimal path for a packet to reach its destination.

#### 1.3 Port Addressing (Layer 4)

*   **Purpose:** Identifies a specific application or process running on a host. This allows multiple applications on a single device to share the same network connection and receive their respective data.
*   **Format:** A 16-bit integer number ranging from 0 to 65535.
*   **Categories:**
    *   **Well-known Ports (0-1023):** Reserved for common network services (e.g., HTTP uses port 80, HTTPS uses 443, FTP uses 20/21, DNS uses 53).
    *   **Registered Ports (1024-49151):** Can be registered with IANA for specific services, but can also be used by user applications.
    *   **Dynamic/Private Ports (49152-65535):** Used by client applications when initiating connections and are dynamically assigned for a short period.
*   **Role:** The combination of an IP address and a port number (known as a socket address) uniquely identifies a specific process on a specific host, enabling process-to-process communication.

#### 1.4 Application Layer Addressing (Layer 5/7)

*   **Purpose:** User-friendly addresses that map to underlying IP addresses and port numbers, making it easier for humans to interact with network services.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Domain Name System (DNS) Names / Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs):** E.g., `www.example.com`. DNS resolves these human-readable names into IP addresses.
    *   **Uniform Resource Locators (URLs):** E.g., `https://www.example.com/page.html`. A URL specifies the protocol, domain name, and specific resource path.
    *   **Email Addresses:** E.g., `user@example.com`.
*   **Role:** Provides a level of abstraction, allowing users to access services without needing to know their underlying numerical IP and port addresses.

**Summary:**
The TCP/IP model's multi-layered addressing system provides a robust framework for network communication. MAC addresses handle local delivery, IP addresses enable global routing, port numbers direct data to specific applications, and application-layer addresses offer user-friendly identification of resources.

### 2. Guided Transmission Media (CO1)

Guided transmission media, also known as wired media or bounded media, are physical links that guide electromagnetic waves along a solid medium. These media provide a physical path for signals, offering control over signal propagation and generally resulting in higher reliability and less susceptibility to interference compared to unguided (wireless) media over the same distance. The three main types are twisted-pair cable, coaxial cable, and fiber-optic cable.

#### 2.1 Twisted-Pair Cable

*   **Description:** Consists of two insulated copper wires twisted together. Multiple twisted pairs are often bundled into a single cable.
*   **Principle:** The twisting of the wires helps to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) from external sources and crosstalk (interference between adjacent pairs) by canceling out magnetic fields. The number of twists per unit length affects the cable's performance.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Unshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP):** The most common type, without any metallic shield around the pairs. It is inexpensive and easy to install. Used extensively in Ethernet LANs (e.g., Cat 5e, Cat 6).
    *   **Shielded Twisted-Pair (STP):** Each pair, or the entire bundle of pairs, is wrapped in a metallic foil or braided mesh shield. This additional shielding provides better protection against EMI and crosstalk, making it suitable for environments with high electrical noise. However, it is more expensive and harder to install than UTP.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Bandwidth:** Varies greatly by category (e.g., Cat 5e supports Gigabit Ethernet, Cat 6a supports 10 Gigabit Ethernet).
    *   **Distance:** Effective for relatively short distances (typically up to 100 meters for Ethernet).
    *   **Cost:** Relatively low.
    *   **Installation:** Easy.
*   **Applications:**
    *   Ethernet Local Area Networks (LANs).
    *   Telephone networks (e.g., DSL lines).
    *   Security systems.

```
*(For STP, an additional metallic shield layer would be present just inside the outer jacket, and sometimes around individual pairs.)*

#### 2.2 Coaxial Cable

*   **Description:** Consists of a central copper conductor, surrounded by an insulating layer, which is then encased by a woven metallic braid or foil (the shield), and finally covered by an outer insulating jacket.
*   **Principle:** The concentric design and shielding significantly reduce electromagnetic interference and signal leakage, providing better performance over longer distances and higher bandwidths than twisted-pair for certain applications.
*   **Types (Historically for LANs):**
    *   **Thinnet (10Base2):** Thinner, more flexible, and easier to install, but had lower maximum segment length (185m).
    *   **Thicknet (10Base5):** Thicker, less flexible, but supported longer segment lengths (500m).
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Bandwidth:** Supports higher bandwidth than UTP for early Ethernet implementations, and still widely used for high-bandwidth cable TV.
    *   **Distance:** Better than UTP for early Ethernet, but now surpassed by fiber.
    *   **Cost:** Moderately expensive.
    *   **Installation:** More difficult than UTP due to stiffness and specific connectors.
*   **Applications:**
    *   Cable television (CATV) distribution.
    *   Broadband internet connections (DOCSIS).
    *   Historically, older Ethernet LANs.
    *   Long-distance telephone transmission (though largely replaced by fiber).

#### 2.3 Fiber-Optic Cable

*   **Description:** Transmits data as pulses of light through a thin strand of glass or plastic (the core). The core is surrounded by a cladding layer, which has a lower refractive index, allowing light to be guided through the core by total internal reflection. A buffer coating and an outer jacket protect the core and cladding.
*   **Principle:** Light signals are sent through the core, reflecting off the cladding layer. Due to total internal reflection, light waves travel along the core without significant loss, enabling long-distance high-speed transmission.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Single-Mode Fiber (SMF):** Has a very small core diameter (8-10 microns), allowing only a single path for light to travel. This minimizes signal dispersion, enabling much longer distances and higher bandwidths. Typically uses laser light sources.
    *   **Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF):** Has a larger core diameter (50 or 62.5 microns), allowing multiple light paths (modes) to propagate. This leads to modal dispersion (light pulses arrive at different times), limiting distance and bandwidth compared to SMF. Typically uses LED light sources.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Bandwidth:** Extremely high bandwidth, capable of supporting terabits per second.
    *   **Distance:** Very long distances (kilometers to hundreds of kilometers for SMF) without repeaters.
    *   **Immunity to EMI:** Completely immune to electromagnetic interference, radio frequency interference, and crosstalk, as it transmits light, not electrical signals.
    *   **Security:** More secure as it's difficult to tap without detection.
    *   **Cost:** More expensive than copper cables and requires specialized installation and equipment (transceivers).
    *   **Installation:** More delicate and requires specialized skills and tools.
*   **Applications:**
    *   Long-haul telecommunications (backbone networks, submarine cables).
    *   High-speed data centers.
    *   Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) and Fiber-to-the-Office (FTTO).
    *   High-EMI environments (e.g., industrial plants).

| **Applications**| LANs, Telephony               | Cable TV, Broadband Internet      | Backbone networks, Data Centers, FTTH|

In conclusion, the choice of guided transmission media depends on factors such as required bandwidth, transmission distance, cost, environment (e.g., EMI levels), and security considerations. Each type offers distinct advantages for specific networking scenarios.

### 3. Go-Back-N ARQ and Selective Repeat ARQ (CO2)

Go-Back-N ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) and Selective Repeat ARQ are two common protocols used in the data link layer (and sometimes transport layer) to provide reliable data transfer over an unreliable communication channel. Both use a sliding window mechanism for flow control and error control, involving sequence numbers, acknowledgements (ACKs), and timers. The main difference lies in how they handle lost or corrupted frames and subsequent retransmissions.

#### 3.1 Go-Back-N ARQ

Go-Back-N ARQ is a specific instance of the sliding window protocol where the sender can transmit multiple frames without waiting for an acknowledgement for each frame. However, the receiver only accepts frames in sequential order.

**How it Works:**

1.  **Sender Behavior:**
    *   Maintains a **sending window** of size *N*. This window represents the sequence numbers of frames that can be sent without waiting for an ACK.
    *   Sends frames sequentially, assigning a sequence number to each.
    *   Starts a timer for each unacknowledged frame.
    *   If an ACK for a frame `k` is received, the window slides forward, allowing new frames to be sent.
    *   **Retransmission:** If a timer for a frame `k` expires before its ACK is received (implying the frame `k` or its ACK was lost/corrupted), the sender **retransmits frame `k` and all subsequent frames** that were already sent (frames `k`, `k+1`, `k+2`, ... up to the last sent frame). This is the "Go-Back-N" aspect.

2.  **Receiver Behavior:**
    *   Maintains a **receiving window** of size 1. This means the receiver is only expecting a specific frame, say `k`.
    *   If frame `k` is received correctly and in order, the receiver delivers it to the upper layer and sends a **cumulative ACK** for `k+1` (indicating that all frames up to `k` have been received correctly and the receiver is now expecting `k+1`). The receiver's window slides to `k+1`.
    *   **Out-of-Order Frames:** If a frame `m` is received where `m != k` (i.e., it's out-of-order or `k` was missing), the receiver **discards** frame `m` and **resends an ACK for `k`** (the last correctly received in-order frame). It does not buffer out-of-order frames.

**Example Scenario (with a lost frame):**

*   Sender sends frames 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
*   Frame 2 is lost.
*   Receiver receives frame 0, sends ACK 1.
*   Receiver receives frame 1, sends ACK 2.
*   Receiver receives frame 3 (out of order, expects frame 2). Discards frame 3, sends ACK 2 (again).
*   Receiver receives frame 4 (out of order, expects frame 2). Discards frame 4, sends ACK 2 (again).
*   Sender's timer for frame 2 expires.
*   Sender retransmits frames 2, 3, 4.
*   Receiver receives frame 2, sends ACK 3.
*   Receiver receives frame 3, sends ACK 4.
*   Receiver receives frame 4, sends ACK 5.

**Advantages:**
*   Simpler receiver logic as it doesn't need to buffer out-of-order frames.
*   Only a single timer is often needed at the sender (for the oldest unacknowledged frame).

**Disadvantages:**
*   Inefficient in channels with high error rates, as a single lost frame leads to the retransmission of many frames, including those already correctly received. This wastes bandwidth.

**Diagram:**

```

<---------------------------------------------

<--------------------------------------------
```

#### 3.2 Selective Repeat ARQ

Selective Repeat ARQ improves upon Go-Back-N by retransmitting only the specific frames that are lost or corrupted. This requires a more complex receiver that can buffer out-of-order frames.

**How it Works:**

1.  **Sender Behavior:**
    *   Maintains a **sending window** of size *N*.
    *   Sends frames sequentially.
    *   Starts a timer for **each unacknowledged frame**.
    *   Receives ACKs (or Negative ACKs - NAKs) for individual frames.
    *   If an ACK for frame `k` is received, frame `k` is marked as received, and its timer is stopped. The window slides forward when the smallest-numbered unacknowledged frame is acknowledged.
    *   **Retransmission:** If a timer for a frame `k` expires (or a NAK for `k` is received), the sender **retransmits only frame `k`**.

2.  **Receiver Behavior:**
    *   Maintains a **receiving window** of size *N*. This window allows the receiver to accept and buffer out-of-order frames within the window range.
    *   If frame `k` is received correctly (even if out of order but within the window), the receiver stores it in a buffer and sends an **individual ACK** for `k`.
    *   If a frame `k` is received that is the expected in-order frame, and there are buffered frames immediately following `k`, those buffered frames are delivered to the upper layer along with `k`. The receiving window then slides forward by the number of frames delivered.
    *   If an expected frame `k` is missing, but later frames `k+1`, `k+2`, etc., are received, the receiver buffers them and continues to send ACKs for them. It waits for `k`.
    *   A NAK (Negative Acknowledgement) might also be used to explicitly inform the sender about a missing frame `k`, but simply not acknowledging `k` also serves this purpose in conjunction with timers.

**Example Scenario (with a lost frame):**

*   Sender sends frames 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
*   Frame 2 is lost.
*   Receiver receives frame 0, sends ACK 0.
*   Receiver receives frame 1, sends ACK 1.
*   Receiver receives frame 3 (out of order, expects frame 2 but within window). Buffers frame 3, sends ACK 3.
*   Receiver receives frame 4 (out of order, expects frame 2 but within window). Buffers frame 4, sends ACK 4.
*   Sender's timer for frame 2 expires.
*   Sender retransmits only frame 2.
*   Receiver receives frame 2. Now it has 2, 3, 4 in order. Delivers 2, 3, 4 to the upper layer. Sends ACK 5.
*   Sender receives ACK 2, 3, 4. Window slides forward.

**Advantages:**
*   Much more efficient in channels with high error rates, as only lost or corrupted frames are retransmitted, minimizing bandwidth waste.

**Disadvantages:**
*   More complex receiver logic, requiring buffering of out-of-order frames and management of multiple timers at the sender.
*   Both sender and receiver windows must be less than or equal to half the sequence number space (window size + 1 <= sequence number range / 2) to avoid ambiguity issues when ACKs are lost.

### 4. CSMA/CA and CSMA/CD Procedures

CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) and CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) are Media Access Control (MAC) protocols used in shared medium networks to manage how multiple devices can share a single transmission channel and prevent or handle data collisions.

#### 4.1 CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)

*   **Context:** Primarily used in wired Ethernet networks operating in a shared bus or hub topology (e.g., 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BASE-T with a hub). It is no longer relevant for modern switched Ethernet networks, where each device typically has its own dedicated collision domain.
*   **Principle:** "Listen before talk, and listen while talk." Stations first check if the channel is idle. If it is, they transmit. While transmitting, they continue to monitor the channel for collisions. If a collision is detected, they stop transmitting, send a jamming signal, and then wait a random amount of time before reattempting transmission.

**Functioning Steps (with Diagrammatic Explanation):**

1.  **Carrier Sense:** A station wanting to transmit (Station A) first listens to the transmission medium to check if it's idle.
    *   **Diagram:**
        ```
        Station A --(Listen)--> ---[Idle Channel]---> Station B
                               <---[No Signal]----
        ```
2.  **Transmit:** If the channel is detected as idle, Station A immediately begins transmitting its data frame.
    *   **Diagram:**
        ```
        Station A --(Transmit Data)--> --[Data A]---> Station B
        ```
3.  **Collision Detection:** While transmitting, Station A continues to monitor the channel for any conflicting signals.
    *   **Scenario:** If another station (Station B) also sensed the channel as idle (perhaps Station A's signal hadn't reached it yet, or they both sensed idle simultaneously), Station B might also start transmitting.
    *   **Diagram (Collision):**
        ```
        Station A --(Transmit Data)--> --[Data A]--->
                                                   X (Collision Point)
        Station B --(Transmit Data)--> --[Data B]--->
        ```
4.  **Jamming Signal:** If Station A detects a collision (e.g., by monitoring an abnormal increase in signal strength or voltage level), it immediately stops transmitting its data frame and sends a brief **jamming signal**. This ensures that all other stations on the segment are aware of the collision.
    *   **Diagram:**
        ```
        Station A --(Jamming Signal)--> --[JAM]---> Station B
        Station B --(Jamming Signal)--> --[JAM]---> Station A
        ```
5.  **Backoff Algorithm:** After sending the jamming signal, each station involved in the collision calculates a random backoff time using a **binary exponential backoff algorithm**. This ensures that stations don't immediately try to retransmit simultaneously again, potentially causing another collision.
    *   **Diagram:**
        ```
        Station A --(Wait Random Time)-->
        Station B --(Wait Random Time)-->
        ```
6.  **Retransmit:** After the backoff time expires, the stations return to Step 1 (Carrier Sense) and attempt to retransmit the frame.

**Advantages:**
*   Efficient for low to moderate network traffic.
*   Relatively simple to implement in wired networks.

**Disadvantages:**
*   Cannot be used in wireless networks due to difficulty in collision detection (e.g., hidden node problem, signal strength variations).
*   Inefficient under heavy network load, as collisions increase significantly.

#### 4.2 CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)

*   **Context:** Primarily used in wireless networks (e.g., Wi-Fi / IEEE 802.11), where collision detection is difficult or impossible. In wireless, a station cannot easily "listen" for collisions while it is transmitting because its own signal can overwhelm its receiver (hidden node problem, differing signal strengths).
*   **Principle:** "Listen before talk, and avoid collisions." Stations attempt to avoid collisions by waiting for a short random period after sensing the channel idle, and relying on positive acknowledgements from the receiver to confirm successful transmission.

**Functioning Steps (with Diagrammatic Explanation):**

1.  **Carrier Sense:** A station (Station A) wanting to transmit first listens to the channel for a specific minimum duration (DIFS - Distributed Interframe Space) to determine if it's idle. This involves both physical carrier sense (detecting RF energy) and virtual carrier sense (using Network Allocation Vector - NAV, derived from RTS/CTS or duration fields in frames).
    *   **Diagram:**
        ```
        Station A --(Listen DIFS)--> ---[Idle Channel]---> Station B
                                    <---[No Signal]----
        ```
2.  **Random Backoff:** If the channel is idle for DIFS, Station A then enters a random backoff period before transmitting. This random delay helps to minimize the chance of multiple stations transmitting simultaneously if they all sensed the channel idle at the same time. The backoff value is chosen from a contention window.
    *   **Diagram:**
        ```
        Station A --(DIFS)-->(Random Backoff)-->
        ```
3.  **Transmit:** If the channel remains idle during the entire backoff period, Station A transmits its data frame.
    *   **Diagram:**
        ```
        Station A --(Transmit Data)--> --[Data A]---> Access Point (AP)
        ```
4.  **Acknowledgement (ACK):** The receiving station (e.g., Access Point) must send a positive acknowledgement (ACK) back to the sender within a very short interframe space (SIFS - Short Interframe Space) if the data frame was received correctly.
    *   **Diagram:**
        ```
        Access Point (AP) --(ACK for A)--> Station A
        ```
5.  **Retransmission:** If Station A does not receive the ACK within a specified timeout, it assumes a collision occurred or the frame was lost. It then re-enters the contention process (Step 1) with an increased contention window to attempt retransmission.

**Optional RTS/CTS (Request To Send / Clear To Send) Mechanism:**
To further mitigate the "hidden node problem" (where two stations cannot hear each other but both can hear the AP), CSMA/CA can use a reservation mechanism:

1.  **RTS (Request To Send):** Station A sends a short RTS frame to the AP, indicating its intention to transmit and the duration required.
    *   **Diagram:**
        ```
        Station A --(RTS)--> AP
        ```
2.  **CTS (Clear To Send):** If the AP receives the RTS, it responds with a CTS frame, granting permission to transmit for the specified duration.
    *   **Diagram:**
        ```
        AP --(CTS)--> Station A
        ```
3.  **NAV (Network Allocation Vector):** All other stations that hear either the RTS or CTS frames update their NAV, indicating how long the channel will be busy. They then defer their transmissions for that duration, effectively avoiding collisions.
    *   **Diagram:**
        ```
        Station A --> AP <-- Station C (Hidden from A)
                  (RTS)        (hears AP's CTS, sets NAV)
        ```
4.  Station A then transmits its data frame, followed by the AP's ACK.

**Advantages:**
*   Works effectively in wireless environments where collision detection is problematic.
*   RTS/CTS helps to mitigate the hidden node problem and ensures fair access.

**Disadvantages:**
*   Introduces overhead (DIFS, SIFS, backoff, ACKs, RTS/CTS) which can reduce throughput compared to collision-free wired networks.
*   More complex to implement than basic CSMA/CD.
